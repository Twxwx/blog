-  Our main proposal is to leverage V&L models to improve these pseudo labels and have one unified way of improving
the accuracy in multiple settings

- To improve localization, we propose two strategies where the two-stage proposal generator helps the V&L model: (1) Fusing CLIP scores and objectness scores of the two-stage proposal generator, and (2) removing redundant proposals by repeated application of the localization head (2nd stage) in the proposal generator. Finally, the generated pseudo labels are combined with the original ground truth to train the final detector.
